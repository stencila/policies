Complete details on each type of Personal Data collected are provided in

texts displayed prior to the Data collection.

Personal Data may be freely provided by the User, or, in case of Usage
Data, collected automatically when using Stencila Hub.

Unless specified otherwise, all Data requested by Stencila Hub is
mandatory and failure to provide this Data may make it impossible for

specifically states that some Data is not mandatory, Users are free not
to communicate this Data without consequences to the availability or the
functioning of the Service.

Users who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are
welcome to contact the Owner.

Any use of Cookies -- or of other tracking tools -- by Stencila Hub or
by the owners of third-party services used by Stencila Hub serves the
purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in addition to
any other purposes described in the present document and in the Cookie
Policy, if available.

Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained,
published or shared through Stencila Hub and confirm that they have the
third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.


Mode and place of processing the Data
-------------------------------------

### Methods of processing

The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized
access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the
Data.

The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled
tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to
the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the
Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved
with the operation of Stencila Hub (administration, sales, marketing,
legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party
technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT
companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data
Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be
requested from the Owner at any time.

### Legal basis of processing

The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the
following applies:

-   Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.
    Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process
    Personal Data until the User objects to such processing ("opt-out"),
    without having to rely on consent or any other of the following
    legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing
    of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
-   provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement
    with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
-   processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
    which the Owner is subject;
-   processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public
    interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the
    Owner;
-   processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
    pursued by the Owner or by a third party.

In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal
basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the
provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or
a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

### Place

The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other
places where the parties involved in the processing are located.

Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve
transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own. To find
out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users
can check the section containing details about the processing of
Personal Data.

Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers
to a country outside the European Union or to any international
organization governed by public international law or set up by two or
more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by
the Owner to safeguard their Data.

If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking
the relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner using
the information provided in the contact section.

### Retention time

Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by
the purpose they have been collected for.

Therefore:

-   Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a
    contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until such
    contract has been fully performed.
-   Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner's legitimate
    interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such
    purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the
    legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant
    sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.

The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period
whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such
consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to
retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for
the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.

Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to
rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after
expiration of the retention period.
